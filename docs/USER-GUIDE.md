## üìà Interpreting Trends

### What to Watch For

#### Sudden Spikes

- **CISA KEV spikes** = Major exploitation campaigns
- **NVD CVE spikes** = Mass vulnerability discoveries
- **ATT&CK updates** = New attack techniques identified

#### Gradual Increases

- **Normal growth** in attack surface and threats
- **Plan security scaling** accordingly
- **Opportunity for proactive measures**

#### Correlations

- **High CISA KEV + High CVE** = Active threat period requiring heightened response
- **New techniques + CVE spikes** = Potential new attack campaigns

### Using Data for Decisions

#### Security Team Prioritization

1. **Start with CISA KEV** - these are actively exploited
2. **Add Critical CVEs** - highest severity new threats
3. **Consider ATT&CK popularity** - focus on common attack methods

#### Executive Reporting

- **CISA KEV totals** for immediate threat context
- **CVE trends** for ongoing risk management
- **ATT&CK coverage** for strategic planning

#### Budget Justification

- **Higher metrics** = stronger case for security investment
- **Trend analysis** = capacity planning for security teams
- **Vendor analysis** = risk assessment for technology choices

## üéØ Best Practices

### Daily Monitoring

- Check dashboard each morning for overnight changes
- Focus on CISA KEV for immediate threats
- Monitor Critical CVE count for new high-severity issues

### Weekly Reviews

- Analyze trends and patterns
- Review vendor/product distributions
- Assess ATT&CK technique coverage

### Monthly Analysis

- Compare metrics month-over-month
- Identify seasonal patterns
- Plan security initiatives based on trends

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Limitations

### What Metrics Don't Show

- **Your specific risk** depends on your actual technology stack
- **Threat actors targeting your industry** may use different techniques
- **Internal threats** and misconfigurations aren't captured
- **Zero-day attacks** won't appear until publicly disclosed

### Context Matters

- **Volume isn't everything** - one critical vulnerability can be worse than many minor ones
- **Combine with other intelligence** - use additional threat feeds and internal data
- **Consider your environment** - interpret metrics within your specific risk context

## üîÑ Data Refresh

### Auto-refresh Behavior

- **Widgets update automatically** at configured intervals (30s - 1hr)
- **Data ingestion runs independently** (manual or scheduled)
- **"Last updated" timestamps** show data freshness

### Manual Data Loading

Access Settings page for manual ingestion triggers, or use API:

```bash
# Trigger fresh data ingestion
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/ingestion/cisa-kev
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/ingestion/nvd-cve
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/ingestion/mitre-attack
```

## üöÄ Tips for Power Users

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Refresh page** - F5 or Ctrl+R for manual refresh
- **Browser zoom** - Ctrl +/- to adjust widget sizes
- **Full screen** - F11 for distraction-free monitoring

### Multiple Dashboards

- **Create focused dashboards** for different purposes (executive, analyst, operations)
- **Use descriptive names** to quickly identify dashboard purpose
- **Share configurations** by copying dashboard JSON

### API Access

```bash
# Direct API access for automation
curl http://localhost:3000/api/metrics/cisa/total-count
curl http://localhost:3000/api/dashboards
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
```

**Remember**: CyberDash provides situational awareness, but combine it with threat intelligence specific to your industry and environment for informed security decisions.

# Data Ingestion

CyberDash supports ingesting security data from three major sources:

## üéØ Supported Data Sources

### 1. CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV)

- **Source**: CISA KEV Catalog
- **Endpoint**: `https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/feeds/known_exploited_vulnerabilities.json`
- **Update Frequency**: Daily
- **Data**: Known exploited vulnerabilities with due dates

### 2. NVD CVE Database

- **Source**: NIST National Vulnerability Database
- **Endpoint**: `https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/2.0/`
- **Rate Limit**: 5 requests per 30 seconds (without API key)
- **Data**: Complete CVE details with CVSS scores

### 3. MITRE ATT&CK Framework

- **Source**: MITRE ATT&CK STIX Data
- **Endpoint**: `https://api.github.com/repos/mitre-attack/attack-stix-data/releases/latest`
- **Update Frequency**: When new releases are published
- **Data**: Tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)

## üöÄ **Fixed Commands (Updated)**

All data ingestion endpoints have been updated with the correct API parameters:

```bash
# ‚úÖ CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/ingestion/cisa-kev

# ‚úÖ NVD CVE Database (Fixed API 2.0 parameters)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/ingestion/nvd-cve

# ‚úÖ MITRE ATT&CK Framework (Fixed GitHub access)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/ingestion/mitre-attack
```

## üîß **What Was Fixed**

### 1. **NVD CVE API Issue**

- **Problem**: NVD API 2.0 requires both `lastModStartDate` AND `lastModEndDate` parameters
- **Solution**: Updated to provide both start and end dates for proper filtering
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **Fixed and working**

### 2. **MITRE ATT&CK API Issue**

- **Problem**: Enterprise ATT&CK JSON file not found in GitHub release assets
- **Solution**: Added fallback to download directly from repository when asset not found
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **Fixed and working**

### 3. **CISA KEV API**

- **Status**: ‚úÖ **Already working correctly**

## üîß Running Data Ingestion

### Using cURL Commands

```bash
# Make sure your development server is running
cd cyberDash/apps/web
npm run dev

# In a new terminal, run ingestion commands:

# 1. CISA KEV Data (typically 2-5 minutes)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/ingestion/cisa-kev

# 2. NVD CVE Data (may take 15-30 minutes for initial run)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/ingestion/nvd-cve

# 3. MITRE ATT&CK Data (typically 1-2 minutes)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/ingestion/mitre-attack
```

### Using the Web Interface

1. Navigate to the Admin Dashboard (if available)
2. Go to Data Management ‚Üí Ingestion
3. Click "Run Ingestion" for each data source

### Checking Ingestion Status

```bash
# Check ingestion logs
curl http://localhost:3000/api/ingestion/status

# Check specific source status
curl http://localhost:3000/api/ingestion/cisa-kev
curl http://localhost:3000/api/ingestion/nvd-cve
curl http://localhost:3000/api/ingestion/mitre-attack
```

## ‚è±Ô∏è Expected Duration & Data Volume

| Source           | Initial Run   | Incremental | Records   |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ----------- | --------- |
| **CISA KEV**     | 2-5 minutes   | 30 seconds  | ~1,200    |
| **NVD CVE**      | 15-30 minutes | 2-5 minutes | ~250,000+ |
| **MITRE ATT&CK** | 1-2 minutes   | 30 seconds  | ~800      |

## üö¶ Rate Limiting & Best Practices

### NVD API Rate Limits

- **Without API Key**: 5 requests per 30 seconds
- **With API Key**: 50 requests per 30 seconds
- CyberDash automatically handles rate limiting

### Recommended Schedule

```bash
# Daily ingestion (recommended cron schedule)
0 2 * * * curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/ingestion/cisa-kev
0 3 * * * curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/ingestion/nvd-cve
0 4 * * * curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/ingestion/mitre-attack
```

## üîç Monitoring & Troubleshooting

### View Ingestion Logs

```bash
# Database logs (if using a database viewer)
SELECT * FROM data_ingestion_log ORDER BY started_at DESC LIMIT 10;

# Application logs
docker logs cyberdash-web -f
```

### Common Issues

- **Rate Limiting**: NVD may return 403 errors if rate limits exceeded
- **Network Timeouts**: Large CVE datasets may cause timeouts on slower connections
- **Memory Usage**: Initial NVD ingestion can use significant memory

### Success Indicators

- HTTP 200 response with JSON containing `success: true`
- Records processed count matches expected data volume
- Updated timestamps in ingestion state
